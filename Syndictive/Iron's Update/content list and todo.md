# Idea for an Update to *Syndictive*
This update would add ***Iron's Spells and Spellbooks***.

## Overview and To-Do
Update would completely remove the original content of the mod, if not leaving some things behind.
- This would include:
  - Removing all existing spells.
    - This is to make way for new spells.
  - Removing all of the bosses.
    - If most of the content is being removed, certain bosses would no longer fit. If not all of the bosses.
  - Removing all of the structures.
    - Ditto the same reason with bosses.
  - Removing all of the items, or doing something else with them.
  - Ditto the items stuff with blocks and stations.
  - **No spell leveling.**

Update would add its own content, or rework existing content.
- This would include:
  - Adding a completely new roster of spells.
  - Keeping some existing spells and giving them a fresh coat of paint, like that of the **Portal** spell.
  - Keeping some core items and blocks, giving them new textures and whatnot.

All the new and reworked content would be fitted to be in line with the theming of other mods within the modpack.
- There would be three main schools:
  - *Mundane*, would classify spells that are unassuming, or basic.
    - Would include basic spells, with no defined theme. (Fireball, bolt, dash, whatnot. Just whatever basic spells.)
    - Replaces *Evocation*.
  - *Esoteric*, would classify more ***Malum*** oriented spells, dark magics, etc.
    - Would include more powerful and dark oriented spells, with the theme of ***Malum***. (Ether something, telekinesis, teleport, probably portal, maybe some powerful blast [Biden Blast??!?!!!1!?!].)
    - Replaces *Ender*.
  - *Hallowed*, would classify more support oriented spells.
    - Would include more supportive and weak spells, aside from smites and whatnot. (Heal aura, holy smite, whatever I can think of.)
    - Replaces *Holy*.
- ~~All~~ Some rarities are shifted and renamed.
  - *Common* is unchanged.
  - *Uncommon* is renamed to *Rare*.
  - *Rare* is renamed to *Epic*.
  - *Epic* is renamed to *Legendary*.
  - *Legendary* is renamed to *Flawless*.

## Spells
All spells will include a list of stats. In order, these stats are *Cast Type*, *Cooldown*, *Mana Cost*, *Rarity*, and whatever additional tidbits need to be added.
