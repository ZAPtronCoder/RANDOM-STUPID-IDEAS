Chainmail Set Bonus:
- +2 Unarmed Proficiency
  - *Unarmed Proficiency* will increase Attack Damage, Attack Knockback, and Attack Speed by ***x*** value when not holding an item in either hand.
  - This ties into the gimmick factor of Chainmail armor, which already increases Attack Damage.
  - The whole idea of being a glass cannon is reinforced with this *Unarmed Proficiency* thing.

Gold Set Bonus:
- +2 Luck
  - Simple addition that makes full gold armor a bit more versitile.

Silver Set Bonus:
- +1.5 Attack Range
- +1.5 Reach Distance
