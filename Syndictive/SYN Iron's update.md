Would completely remove the original content of the mod, if not leaving some things behind.
- This would include:
  - Removing all existing spells.
  - Removing all of the bosses.
  - Removing all of the structures.
  - Removing all of the items, or doing something else with them.
  - Ditto the items stuff with blocks and stations.

Would add its own content, or rework existing content.
- This would include:
  - Adding a completely new roster of spells.
  - Keeping some existing spells and giving them a fresh coat of paint, like that of the **Portal** spell.
  - Keeping some core items and blocks, giving them new textures and whatnot.

All the new and reworked content would be fitted to be in line with the theming of ***Malum***.
- There would be three main schools:
  - *Mundane*, would classify spells that are unassuming, or basic.
    - Would include basic spells, with no defined theme. (Fireball, Bolt, Dash, and whatnot. Just whatever basic spells.)
    - Replaces *Evocation*.
  - *Esoteric*, would classify more ***Malum*** oriented spells, dark magics, etc.
    - Would include more powerful and dark oriented spells, with the theme of ***Malum***. (Ether Flame, Telekinesis, Teleport, probably Portal, maybe some powerful blast [Biden Blast].)
    - Replaces *Ender*.
  - *Hallowed*, would classify more support oriented spells.
    - Would include more supportive and weak spells, aside from smites and whatnot. (Heal Aura, Holy Smite, whatever I can think of.)
    - Replaces *Holy*.
