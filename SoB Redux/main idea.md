# Smidgeon O' Bliss Redux
This file contains info on a possible remake to my popular mod **Smidgeon O' Bliss** (I'll be shortening all future references of the mod to "**SoB**"). Use this as the "manifesto" for the future of **SoB**.

So, I'll first answer a couple of questions I made up in my head that I feel like some people would ask pertaining to this idea.

### Why remake SoB?
I have come to realize that the content of **SoB** is cluttered, the mod tab (in-game) is unorganized, and the mod page (on CurseForge) doesn't really tell people all about the content of the mod. It's also buggy due to the mod relying on **Json Things**. It's about time to do something about it, and recode it.

As mentioned prior, I want to start from scratch with the content, but port a few things (like some classics/originals of the mod such as Cinder Bread) to make it still feel like the original **SoB**.

The more content I add, the messier the files become; and because I am using **Json Things**, I can't organize the content in stuff like Java classes, making it harder to manage existing content and adding new content.

### What would the mod even look like?
Expect a small amount of content to begin with.

I want to make this mod feel like an expansion pack (in terms of "expanding on the food based aspects [...] with content, [...] compatibility, elaborating on existing features, tweaks, and more!", quote: me) to every mod you add with it. Like yes, it won't be all mods, but I do want it to add food content and integration for mods like **Farmer's Delight**, **Create**, and **Malum** (just like with original **SoB**).

I want to have better organization with the mod. As I stated in the previous question, the mod would be less messy and more cohesive, with items organized properly it the mod tab, with the wiki looking better.

### So, uh... any ideas as to when you are going to do this?

I feel like this is something I should do myself. I need to learn Java, and to learn how to setup MDKs, and to learn how to add items, then fooditems to the mod... whatever, it's a complicated process and I don't know whenever I'll get to doing it. 

I'm quite busy in my personal life and take most time on my computer to decompress, so I don't know if I will ever get to do, well, anything with this idea.

I could use some of your guy's help, like any pointers to where I could learn Java and how to make mods would be nice. Would help speed up the process, and I'm always open for critique and ideas.
