# Smidgeon O' Bliss Redux
This file contains info on a possible remake to my popular mod **Smidgeon O' Bliss** (I'll be shortening all future references of the mod to "**SoB**").

So, I'll first answer a couple of questions I made up in my head that I feel like some people would ask pertaining to this idea.

### Why remake SoB?
I have come to realize that the content of **SoB** is cluttered, the mod tab (in-game) is unorganized, and the mod page (on CurseForge) doesn't really tell people all about the content of the mod. It's also buggy due to the mod relying on **Json Things**. It's about time to do something about it, and recode it.

As mentioned prior, I want to start from scratch with the content, but port a few things (like some classics/originals of the mod such as Cinder Bread) to make it still feel like the original **SoB**.
