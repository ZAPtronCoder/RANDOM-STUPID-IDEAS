# Roadmap
The file contains my plan for the content of **SoB**.

### Initial Re-Release
The my plans for the content of the initial re-release would include the classics, most of the event submission items, an maybe two other foods that I deem fit.
This includes:
- Cinder Bread (and Dough)
- Exotic Fruit Salad
- Exquisite Mushroom Soup
- Bubble Tea
- Duality Tea
- Aloe Tea
- Propelpearl Caviar
- Duck Sandwich
I am cutting all other content out of the mod, like the smoothies, the milks, all the roll/bun items, and the other miscellaneous drinks. All the tag compatibility and recipe compatibility will probably remain, as it is one of the integral parts of **SoB**.

### First Content Update
From now on, I will be theming my updates to the mod. I want this first update to be booze-centric, as in the booze from **Brewin' And Chewin'**, because I've always wanted to add alcohol to **SoB**.
