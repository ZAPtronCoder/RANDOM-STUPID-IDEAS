# Unturned Medieval
# Main Idea
**Unturned Medieval** would be a map centered around medieval times. It would limit the player resource wise and tool wise, as this is before a time of incredibly ~~innovative~~ advanced technology. There would be no guns, and most combat between zombies (and probably players ~~but~~ that's a ~~stupid~~ great idea) would be melee-centric. Healing would be more difficult, as there was barely sanitization. And food is scarce. You are going to have to think like a resourceful peasant.

# Content
Tools would consist of:
- Saws, Knives, and Hammers for crafting structures and barricades, or salvaging items.
- Mortar & Pestles for crushing resources like herbs and sulfur for use in medicine.
- Pickaxes and Axes for resource gathering, collecting wood, stone, and ore for use in structures.

Weapons would consist of:
- Melees:
   - Knives as a weak, short ranged melee for the early game.
   - Spears as a cheap, long-range alternative to other melees.
   - Swords and Greatswords as an expensive, stronger melee.
   - Maces, Hammers, and Clubs for heavier damage, but shorter range.

- Bows:
   - Bows as an early game ranged option to provide some semblance of distance between a foe.
   - Crossbows as a stronger, better ranged string-drawn weapon, with more options for customization.
   - Wristbows as less bulky, faster firing, weaker alternative to a crossbow. Not realistic for the medieval times but more weapon variety is good.

- Black powder weaponry:
   - Flintlock Pistols as a small, inaccurate, high damage, slow to reload, ranged weapon. More dedicated to a mid-to-late game.
   - Flintlock Muskets as a long, "accurate", high damage, slow to reload, longer ranged, ranged weapon. Dedicated to later game.
   - Cannons? Handheld cannons? A literal hand cannon? Maybe.
 
Food and water would consist of:
- Crops and forage crops. Either you grow it or search for it.
- Game or farm meat. Raid farms or raid forests for fresh meat. Cook it to not hurt yourself.
- Assembled, or processed food items, meals. Bread, cheese, soups, platters, whatnot.
- Water flasks, pots, or other containers. Fill flasks with water and heat them to somewhat purify them.
- Booze. Cellars contain drinkables alternative to water, and maybe better than water.
