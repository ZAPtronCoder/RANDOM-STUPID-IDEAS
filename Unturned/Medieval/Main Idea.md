# Unturned Medieval
# Main Idea
**Unturned Medieval** would be a map centered around medieval times. It would limit the player resource wise and tool wise, as this is before a time of incredibly innovative technology. There would be no guns, and most combat between zombies (and probably players but that's a stupid idea) would be melee-centric. Healing would be more difficult, as there was barely sanitization. And food is scarce. You are going to have to think like a resourceful peasant.

Tools would consist of:
- Saws, Knives, and Hammers for crafting structures and barricades, or salvaging items.
- Mortar & Pestles for crushing resources like herbs and sulfur for use in medicine.
- Pickaxes and Axes for resource gathering, collecting wood, stone, and ore for use in structures.

Weapons would consist of:
- Melees:
   - Knives as a weak, short ranged melee for the early game.
   - Spears as a cheap, long-range alternative to other melees.
   - Swords and Greatswords as an expensive, stronger melee.
   - Maces, Hammers, and Clubs forvheavier damage, but shorter range.
- Bows:
   - Bows for and early game weapon to provide some sort of range.
