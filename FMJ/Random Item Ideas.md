## Guns
### Cheap Guns
These would be made from "Cheap Gun Parts", an item made from cheap materials like flint and copper.

**Lever-Action Shotgun**
- Look is that of a shotgun with a short copper barrel and wooden frame with tube storage underneath the barrel. Has no stock. Grip looks like a lever that is flipped to load in the next shell from the tube.
- Stats are bad, as this is a cheap gun.
   - Awful damage falloff and velocity. Bad range.
   - Bad spread, but one pellet (or arrow, not slug) is guaranteed to be center to the reticle.
   - Holds 3 (+1) *Thin Shells*, 1 second reload (individual), 0.5 second load time (individual).
   - Firerate dependant on load time.
- Made from copper, Cheap Gun Parts, planks, and a lever.
- Flavor text: *"A slip-shod shotgun made from cheap materials. It's grip bends in order to load in shells from its tube.*

### Decent Guns 
These would require "Decent Gun Parts", a more midtier item that requires iron and redstone.

### Pristine Guns
These would require "Pristine Gun Parts", and item that requires more expensive materials.

### Exotic Guns
These would be found as treasure and would do unique and gimmicky things.
