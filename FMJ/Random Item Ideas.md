**Grenade Shells**
- Explosive (does decent AOE at a decent range, does not destroy tiles)
- Sponge (1 large soft sponge, does good damage on a direct hit but is not explosive)
- Ender (launches a pearl when firing, will teleport you to where it lands; causes Enderference if it hits an entity; is not explosive)
- Jumper (deals extra knockback, but deals no damage)
- Bouncy (slimeballs cause grenade to bounce 2 times before exploding)
- Sticky (honey causes grenade to stick to surfaces and explode 2 seconds later)

**Rockets**
- Explosive (does good AOE at a good range, does not destroy tiles)

## Guns
### Cheap Guns
These would be made from "Cheap Gun Parts", an item made from cheap materials like flint and copper.

**Levergun**
- Look is that of a shotgun with a short copper barrel and wooden frame with tube storage underneath the barrel. Has no stock. Grip looks like a lever that is flipped to load in the next shell from the tube.
- Stats are bad, as this is a cheap gun.
   - Awful damage falloff and velocity. Bad range.
   - Awful spread, but one pellet (or arrow, not slug) is guaranteed to be center to the reticle.
   - Holds 2 (+1) *Thin Shells*, 1.5 second reload (individual), 1 second load time (individual), internal.
   - Firerate dependant on load time, pump-action.
- Made from a copper block, Cheap Gun Parts, planks, and a lever.
- Flavor text: *"A slip-shod shotgun made from cheap materials. It's lever grip bends in order to load in shells from its tube.*

**Ballend**
- Look is that of a pistol with a copper barrel with a wooden grip and finger guard. It has a bulbus ball on the end of the slide that looks like a lightning rod.
- Stats are bad, as per all cheap guns.
   - Bad damage falloff and velocity. Bad range.
   - Average spread. Spread gets worse as ammo depletes.
   - Holds 5 (+1) *Pistol Cartridges*, 1 second reload (individual), internal.
   - Average firerate, semiautomatic.
- Made from copper ingots, a lightning rod, Cheap Gun Parts, and planks.
- Flavor text: *"A lightning rod fashioned into the likes of a pistol. It is said that the shots never hit the same target twice."*

**Pipe Rifle**
- Look is that of a rifle with a copper barrel and a bolt. It has a wood finish with no stock.
- Stats are bad, ditto previous cheap gun statements.
   - Bad damage falloff but average velocity. Acceptable range.
   - Average spread.
   - Holds 1 *Rifle Cartridge*, 2 second reload, internal.
   - Firerate dependant on reload time, bolt-action.
- Made from a copper block, a copper ingot, string, a log, and Cheap Gun Parts.
- Flavor text: *"A ordinary gun with no uniqueness to its design, has it's usefulness at midrange."*

### Decent Guns 
These would require "Decent Gun Parts", a more midtier item that requires iron and redstone.

**Piston-Tol**
- Look is that of a pistol with a piston-like slide, it has a barrel and grip of iron (gunmetal-esque).
- Stats are mediocre at best.
   - Average damage falloff and velocity. Decent range.
   - Average spread.
   - Uses *Pistol Mags*, 5 second reload.
   - Average firerate, semiautomatic.
- Made from iron ingots, redstone, Decent Gun Parts, a piston, and a redstone torch. 
- Flavor text: *"A pistol with a slide made from a piston. A nice and average firearm that is all around useful."*

### Pristine Guns
These would require "Pristine Gun Parts", and item that requires more expensive materials.

### Exotic Guns
These would be obtained as treasure or as rare oddities from various sources and would do unique and gimmicky things.

**Stickybomb Launcher**
- Look is that of the Stickybomb Launcher from ***TF2***.
- Stats are... unique. List of the gimmicky stuff is in here too.
   - Isn't effected by damage falloff. Velocity/range is determined by how long the launcher was charged.
   - Has 1Â° of deviation.
   - Holds 6 *Grenade Shells*, 2 second reload (individual), 0.5 second load time (individual), internal.
   - Instead of regular firerate, the gun has "charge", which is charged by holding down the fire key. Takes 5 seconds to fully charge. Charge can be released at any time, affecting velocity/range of the grenade.
   - Cannot aim.
   - *Grenade Shells*, when fired, are converted into *Stickybombs* which will stick to surfaces instead of detonating on contact. *Stickybombs* can be detanated by pressing the aim key while holding the gun. *Stickybombs* can be destroyed by projectiles; and, *Stickybombs* will detonate automatically after 10 minutes of existing, or when over 12 *Stickybombs* are placed. *Honey (Grenade Shell) Stickybombs* will take 2 seconds to detonate after the aim key is pressed.
- Obtained as a rare trade from master *Gunsmith* villagers.
- Flavor text: *"KAHBLOO-AYYY!"*
