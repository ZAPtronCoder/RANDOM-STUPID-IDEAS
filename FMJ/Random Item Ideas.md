## Ammo Types
**Pistol Cartridges**
- Normal
- Blank (fires no bullet)
- Tracer (leaves behind a trail of smoke that can be dyed)
- Shotshell (converts the normal bullet into a spread of 4 small projectiles)

**Rifle Cartridges**
- Normal
- Blank (fires no bullet)
- Tracer (leaves behind a trail of smoke that can be dyed)
- Superspeed (faster and more accurate than regular bullets)

**High-Caliber Cartridges**
- Normal
- Blank (fires no bullet)
- Tracer (leaves behind a trail of smoke that can be dyed)
- Explosive (direct hit damage is lowered but does additional explosive splash damage around it that does not destroy tiles)

**Thin Shells**
- Normal (4 pellets)
- Birdshot (6 pellets, more spread)
- Slug (concentrates all the little bits into one big shot)
- Arrow Flechette (2 arrows instead of pellets)
- Torch Slug (lights targets on fire, places a torch if it lands on a block)

**Shells**
- Normal (6 pellets)
- Birdshot (9 pellets, more spread)
- Slug (concentrates all the little bits into one big shot)
- Arrow Flechette (5 arrows instead of pellets)
- Disruption (shoots a dust cloud projectile that causes an AOE of redstone activation where it lands, heavily affected by gravity)

**Grenade Shells**
- Explosive (does decent AOE at a decent range, does not destroy tiles)
- Sponge (1 large soft sponge, does good damage on a direct hit but is not explosive)
- Ender (launches a pearl when firing, will teleport you to where it lands; causes Enderference if it hits an entity; is not explosive)
- Jumper (deals extra knockback, but deals no damage)
- Bouncy (slimeballs cause grenade to bounce 2 times before exploding)
- Sticky (honey causes grenade to stick to surfaces and explode 2 seconds later)
- Potion (creates a larger lingering area effect cloud where it lands, does not explode)

**Rockets**
- Explosive (does good AOE at a good range, does not destroy tiles)
- Blazing (leaves behind fire and lights nearby entities on fire, does worse damage)
- Flak (launches out 16 arrow-like projectiles in all directions, normal explosion does worse damage and has worse AOE)
- Firework (explodes into fireworks instead of the usual, retains the pattern of the firework used to craft it)
- Terraforming (larger explosion radius that does destroy tiles)
- Jumper (deals extra knockback, but deals no damage)
- Torpedo (works underwater, less so in air; explosions work as normal underwater)

## Guns
### Cheap Guns
These would be made from "Cheap Gun Parts", an item made from cheap materials like flint and copper.

**Levergun**

### Pristine Guns
These would require "Pristine Gun Parts", and item that requires more expensive materials.

**Shulkershot**
- Look is hard to describe so just trust me.
- Stats are pretty good, it also has one cool function.
   - Average damage falloff and velocity. Bullets curve upwards instead of downwards, so... interesting range I guess?

### Exotic Guns
These would be obtained as treasure or as rare oddities from various sources and would do unique and gimmicky things.

**Stickybomb Launcher**
- Look is that of the Stickybomb Launcher from ***TF2***.
- Stats are... unique. List of the gimmicky stuff is in here too.
   - Isn't effected by damage falloff. Velocity/range is determined by how long the launcher was charged.
   - Has 1Â° of deviation.
   - Holds 6 *Grenade Shells*, 2 second reload (individual), 0.5 second load time (individual), internal.
   - Instead of regular firerate, the gun has "charge", which is charged by holding down the fire key. Takes 5 seconds to fully charge. Charge can be released at any time, affecting velocity/range of the grenade.
   - Cannot aim.
   - *Grenade Shells*, when fired, are converted into *Stickybombs* which will stick to surfaces instead of detonating on contact. *Stickybombs* can be detanated by pressing the aim key while holding the gun. *Stickybombs* can be destroyed by projectiles; and, *Stickybombs* will detonate automatically after 10 minutes of existing, or when over 12 *Stickybombs* are placed. *Honey (Grenade Shell) Stickybombs* will take 2 seconds to detonate after the aim key is pressed.
- Obtained as a rare trade from master *Gunsmith* villagers.
- Has a stock attachment point.
- Flavor text: *"KAHBLOO-AYYY!"*

## Attachments
### Barrel 
These would be attached to the barrel of a gun and would modify bullets and the firing of the gun.

**Charger**
- A basic little barrel attachment that would slightly increase the velocity of bullets, effecting range and damage falloff.
- Stats were already explained but whatever.
   - Effects velocity positively.
   - Slightly increases the volume (sound) of gunfire.
- Made with a lightning rod, copper, and redstone.

## Misc. Ideas
**Various Ingredients for Ease of Crafting**
- *Pipes*
   - Made of either copper, iron, or netherite.
   - Used as ingredient for making guns (used as a barrel).
   - Made by putting 3 ingots vertically in a crafting table.
   - Can be placed as a very basic connecting decoration.
   - Can be crafted back into ingots.

**Enchantments**
- *Gunboats*
   - Originally, the idea was for it to be a piece of armor that would go in the boot slot that would provide 50% less self-explosion damage when worn.
   - Now, the concept is for it to be an enchantment for boots, which would initally provide 25% self-explosion damage protection (+25% per level).
   - Would cap at level IV, allowing people to get full self-explosive immunity.

- *Reservoir*
   - An enchantment for magazines.
   - Would increase magazine capacity by 25% (+25% per level).
   - Caps at 100% at IV, doubling mag capacity.

- *Flame*
   - A vanilla enchantment that can be applied to guns that aren't rocket or grenade launchers.
   - Would make bullets fired from the gun ignite enemies for 3 seconds.

- *Curse of Ineptitude*
   - A curse that can be applied to all guns.
   - Gives a gun a 10% chance to misfire, causing a round to be consumed, but no round fired.
   - Becomes 5% if applied to rocket or grenade launchers.

- *Infinity*
   - A vanilla enchantment that can be applied to all guns.
   - Causes all guns to be able to fire spectral bullets when empty.
   - Spectral bullets function just like their normal variants besides a few differences.
      - Spectral bullets do 25% damage (50% less of an explosion radius too for explosive guns) and have slightly worse velocity compared to their normal counterpart.
      - Inherits exotic gun's abilities (ie. firing spectral *Stickybombs* from the *Stickybomb Launcher*).
   - Causes the gun to have unique firing noises when firing spectral bullets.
   - Reloading is normal, no need to reload spectral bullets.
