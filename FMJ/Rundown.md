## What is FMJ?
### The Concept
FMJ (or in better terms, Full Metal Jacket) was originally going to be a fork of popular mod CGM (Mr. Crayfish's Gun Mod), we (being me and squoshi) decided that we would instead start from the ground up -- code from scratch. The mod would have Unturned-styled gunplay and gun customization with all sorts of little special things like enforcing blast jumping, more bullet variants and extended mags, compat with other mods, and whatever I can think of; after all, it's just a concept.

Our plan is to use three library mods to make this whole ordeal work, those mods being:
- Lodestone
    - This will provide us with tools for VFX and GUI related things.
- CoFH Core
    - This will provide us with already existing particles to toy with, textures that dynamically change with stack size, and other misc stuff like the Holding enchantment.
- playerAnimator
    - This will provide us with tools for making things like gun holding animations, reload animations, and even other animation-related things.
