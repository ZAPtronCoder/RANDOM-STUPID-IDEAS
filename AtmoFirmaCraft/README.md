# AtmoFirmaCraft
Welcome to the folder for my in-dev modpack **AtmoFirmaCraft**, a **TerraFirmaCraft** modpack.

**AtmoFirmaCraft** is a **TFC** modpack that adds a lot more difficulty to an already difficult mod in the form of gating normally readily available tools (like the <kbd>F3</kbd> menu or the **Jade**/**WAILA** HUD). It also adds additional vehicles for **TFC**, other than boats, in the form of horse carts and aircraft. It also strives to introduce magic system into **TFC**, via a complete overhaul of **Iron's Spells & Spellbooks** with a touch of a completely custom "god worshiping" system thrown in the mix.

In this idea repository I will be keeping track of ideas I have implemented and ideas I have planned. If yall have ideas feel free to put them in [this place on the Discord server](https://discord.com/channels/1169826316544118785/1175983007333629982).
