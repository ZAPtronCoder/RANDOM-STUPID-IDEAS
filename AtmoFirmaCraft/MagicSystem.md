# Magic System for AMFC
The magic system uses **ISS** (Iron's Spells & Spellbooks) as a base. Completely overhauling and changing what **ISS** normally is to something more archaic and *cool*.

This system is loosely based off an idea I had for a **ISS** overhaul, [which you can find here](https://github.com/ZAPtronCoder/RANDOM-STUPID-IDEAS/tree/main/Syndictive/Iron's%20Update); taking bits and pieces of it and using it in this thingamajig.

## Overview 
The normal amount of schools has been cut down to four, being *Earth* (Nature), *Air* (Light ing), *Fire*, and *Water* (Ice). All othet schools are no more. **{✓}**

Removed a ton of content I deemed unnecessary, see [this](https://github.com/ZAPtronCoder/RANDOM-STUPID-IDEAS/tree/main/Syndictive/Iron's%20Update) for more info, aside from removing all spells. I've kept a few. **{✓}**

There is no spell leveling, only greater versions of spells (ie. fireball and greater fireball). **{✓}**

All spells that explode can damage terrain. All spells that have an AoE or explosive damage range can now damage the caster. **{✓}**

Spell Scrolls have now become Runes, stone tablets with a symbol etched in them to discern the school. Spellbooks have become Spell Tablets, stone tablets that can hold spells. **{✓}**
