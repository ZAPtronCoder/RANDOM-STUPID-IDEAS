## COLLECTIVE DUMB AND NOT SO DUMB IDEAS!!!
Random mod ideas and whatnot, all very cool stuff indeed.

Look in `cool ideas` for good, sick, misc, maybe even awesome ideas for primary Minecraft. ðŸ˜Ž

The `FMJ` folder refers to ideas relating to our indev Minecraft mod, Full Metal Jacket.

The `SoB Redux` folder talks a possible remake of Smidgeon O' Bliss, a mod for Minecraft.

If you take a gander at the `Unturned` folder, you'll see ideas for Unturned related things like ideas for maps or mods.

But, in the `Syndictive` folder, there will be ideas for possible updates to the modpack. No promises, of course.
