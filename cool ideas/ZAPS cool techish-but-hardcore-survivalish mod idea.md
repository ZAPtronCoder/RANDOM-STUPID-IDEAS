# Cool Idea for a Cool Tech Mod but it's a Hardcore Survival Mod and a Magic Mod in a Trench Coat but Not Really

## Short Explanation 
The mod is centered around the idea of keeping yourself alive through the power of clones and modifying yourself (like cybernetics and junk). 

## Long Explanation 
### The Big Problem
Your body would be more susceptible to damage, and damage would be more permanent and not easily healed. 

If you die, you wouldn't be able to respawn without a suitable body (yes this is sort of inspired by **Requiem**, but it would be more limiting, and not superstitious magic crap; it be more like *Rick & Morty* 'Operation: Phoenix' type stuff).

Natural regen would be disabled, as damage cannot be easily shrugged off. Every part of your body has its own health (arms, legs, torso, and head). If your head or torso are to be fully damaged, you would die. If your legs were to take damage, you could get crippled. If your arms are to be damaged, you would become ineffective with using tools and items.

### Tech, Mitigation, and Archaic Ways to Help Yourself
You would have to develop prosthetics, cybernetics, and augments to make your current body less susceptible to damage, or to replace damaged parts of your body.

And/or you could make clones to provide a suitable body to insert yourself into in case of death... or to tag out of a damaged body into a more pristine one.

Or, if you don't want to chicken out of your current body, you could use bandages, splints, casts, and other eays to slowly repair your damaged body, unless a part of your body has suffered fatal damage (in which you would have to use a prosthetic or just live without a limb).

### Tech and Improvement
The cybernetics could also be used to improve yourself even more so, instead of just being a way to mitigate a weak body. 

You could use clones as a way to experiment with cybernetics, using them as a blank slate.

On top of clones and cybernetics, you could also develop exosuits as armor on top of your armor to provide additional protection. Also, wheelchairs for people who are crippled. 

You could combine all three of these things to develop perfect vessels for all sorts of scenarios.
