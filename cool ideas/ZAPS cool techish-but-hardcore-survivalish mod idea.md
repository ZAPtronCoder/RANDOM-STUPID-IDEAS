# Cool Idea for a Cool Tech Mod but it's a Hardcore Survival Mod and a Magic Mod in a Trench Coat but Not Really

## Short Explanation 
The mod is centered around the idea of keeping yourself alive through the power of clones and modifying yourself (like cybernetics and junk). 

## Long Explanation 
### The Big Problem
Your body would be more susceptible to damage, and damage would be more permanent and not easily healed. 

If you die, you wouldn't be able to respawn without a suitable body (yes this is sort of inspired by **Requiem**, but it would be more limiting, and not superstitious magic crap; it be more like *Rick & Morty* 'Operation: Phoenix' type stuff).

Natural regen would be disabled, as damage cannot be easily shrugged off. Every part of your body has its own health (arms, legs, torso, and head). If your head or torso are to be fully damaged, you would die. If your legs were to take damage, you could get crippled. If your arms are to be damaged, you would become ineffective with using tools and items.

### Tech, Mitigation, and Archaic Ways to Help Yourself
You would have to develop prosthetics, cybernetics, and augments to make your current body less susceptible to damage, or to replace damaged parts of your body.

And/or you could make clones to provide a suitable body to insert yourself into in case of death... or to tag out of a damaged body into a more pristine one.

Or, if you don't want to chicken out of your current body, you could use bandages, splints, casts, and other eays to slowly repair your damaged body, unless a part of your body has suffered fatal damage (in which you would have to use a prosthetic or just live without a limb).

### Tech and Improvement
The cybernetics could also be used to improve yourself even more so, instead of just being a way to mitigate a weak body. 

You could use clones as a way to experiment with cybernetics, using them as a blank slate.

On top of clones and cybernetics, you could also develop exosuits as armor on top of your armor to provide additional protection. Also, wheelchairs for people who are crippled. 

You could combine all three of these things to develop perfect vessels for all sorts of scenarios.

### Prosthetics, Cybernetics, and Direct Modifications of the Self
The main deal of the mod is self-modification.

In order to start with modifying yourself, you must obtain a Modification Table, a basic wooden board that you can interact with to lay yourself upon it. You will then need a Bonesaw in order to remove limbs. The Modification Table only allows you to remove limbs and swap them out for more basic/earlygame prosthetics.

A better plan is to reserve modifying yourself on the table for more dire situations. Say, you aren't able to save one of your legs before it suffers fatal damage; so you saw off the defunct leg and put a basic Wooden Peg-Leg in its place, it provides basic mobility, but its better than having no or a defunct leg.

Of course as time goes on you develop better prosthetics, but inevitably you'll want to swap out functional parts of your body for more powerful cybernetics.

To do that you would need to make a Modification Station, a more advanced version of the table, now not requiring you to manually saw off parts of your body to swap out parts. It also enables you to modify your torso and head.

Now, to explain the different types of modifications:
- Prosthetics:
   - ...refer to modifications that act as a simple replacement in the case of a missing limb. Way more earlygame and accesable.
   - Contains modifications like Wooden Peg-Leg, Hook Hand, Stub, and Running Prosthetic.
- Cybernetics:
   - ...refer to modifications that act as a better version of the limb they replace. Meant to totally overhaul a limb and make it way more useful than it was.
   - Contains modifications like Piston Arm, Piston Leg, Iron Fist, and whatever random junk I think up of on the spot.
- Augments:
   - ...refer to modifications for parts of the body that are irreplaceable, like the head and torso. Although not as impactful on the surface, they can be something that can make you absurdly powerful.
   - Contains modifications like Backup Implant, Bionic Heart, and again, whatver junk I can think up of.

### Cloning and Experimentation
Clones! Clones are another integral part of the mod, enabling you to actually respawn; although this is not the only thing you can do with clones.

To start with creating a vessel, you would need a Cloning Vat, an enclosure made from glass and iron. You would then place tge vat down and interact with the vat with a bucket (of water) to fill it with water. 

After the vat is filled with water, you can then interact with it again to open up an interface. You can now start inputting organic material into the vat. You can manually insert items into it or use a hopper/dispenser to do so.

Organic items can be anything ranging from meat to plants, although meat provides way more value in the creation of a clone.

After enough organic material is inserted, you can then interact with the vat again to select what the clone will look like. You can use any player's username, and the clone will look like whatever that player's current skin is.

After the clone has been "stylized", the process will begin. After around two in-game days, the vat will drain, and a finished, empty vessel will be left in the glass vat.

This finished clone can now be used; you can interact with it and pick it up; or, you can insert yourself into it, allowing you to swap into a pristine body. 

You can place clones on Modification Tables/Stations and modify them similarly to how you would modify yourself.
