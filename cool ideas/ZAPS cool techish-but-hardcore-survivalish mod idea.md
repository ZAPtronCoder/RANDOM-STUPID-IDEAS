# Cool Idea for a Cool Tech Mod but it's a Hardcore Survival Mod and a Magic Mod in a Trench Coat

## Short Explanation 
The mod is centered around the idea of keeping yourself alive through the power of clones and modifying yourself (like cybernetics and junk). 

## Long Explanation 
### The Big Problem
Your body would be more susceptible to damage, and damage would be more permanent and not easily healed. 

If you die, you wouldn't be able to respawn without a suitable body (yes this is sort of inspired by **Requiem**, but it would be more limiting, and not superstitious magic crap; it be more like *Rick & Morty* 'Operation: Phoenix' type stuff).

### Tech and Mitigation
You would have to develop cybernetics and augments to make your current body less susceptible to damage.

And you could make clones to provide a suitable body to insert yourself into in case of death... or to tag out of a damaged body into a more pristine one.

### Tech and Improvement
The cybernetics could also be used to improve yourself even more so, instead of just being a way to mitigate a weak body. 

You could use clones as a way to experiment with cybernetics, using them as a blank slate.

Clones could also be modified genetically to make them more "naturally" durable or strong.
