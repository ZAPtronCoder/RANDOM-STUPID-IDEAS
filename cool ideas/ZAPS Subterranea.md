# Idea for a modpack called Subterranea
## Basic Ideas
### Rundown
**Subterranea** is a modpack where you are forever stuck in the Undergarden, a dimension that is quite temperate and damp; full of all sorts of weird and wacky flora, fauna, and materials. This modpack will put as spin on 'survive in *x* dimension' akin to that of popular title modpack **Into the Betweenlands**.

Your one goal (subject to change) is to provide a safe space for yourself to possibly thrive and industrialize in a dimension filled with weird creatures, and find ways to counteract the cycle.

### Changes
#### *Mob Changes*
Many things will be changed, such as making zombies and skeletons spawn in the Undergarden; renaming them to Rotbrawlers and Rotrangers with, of course, corresponding retextures to expand more on Rotspawn.

Creepers will also be turned into rotspawn, becoming Rotbombers that leave a wake of rotdust when they explode, creating some Rotnates that continue to wreak havok on the Undergarden.

#### *The Cycle*
In this modpack, the whole idea of the Undergarden being a more neutral and respiteful will be turned on its head. Via the use of Serene Seasons and Enhanced Celestials, I will make the Undergarden go through a cycle similarly to how regular seasons work. 

But unlike seasons (other than temperature change and growing seasons) it will do a number of other things. It will also have a name change. List of changes for each season below (waxing means early, waning means late):
- Spring:
    - Renamed to the Nocturn.
    - Reduced rotspawn spawns, more serene.
    - Plants will grow slower than normal.
    - Neutral temperature.
    - Flavor text:
        - The Waxing Nocturn, *The hostility of the world has fallen under rest.*
        - The Nocturn, *The world seems quiet.*
        - The Waning Nocturn, *The world shifts from serenity to a more lively and febrile state.*

- Summer:
    - Renamed to the Verdant.
    - Normal rotspawn spawns, less serene.
    - Plants will grow faster than normal.
    - Hot temperature.
    - Flavor text:
        - The Waxing Verdant, *The world becomes more exuberant.*
        - The Verdant, *The world seems more energetic and full of life, good or bad.*
        - The Waning Verdant *The vibrancy of the world seems to fall.*

- Fall:
    - Renamed to the Forebode.
    - Increased rotspawn spawns, not the worse.
    - Plants will grow way slower than normal.
    - Neutral, but slightly more cold temperature.
    - Flavor text:
        - The Waxing Forbode, *The world grows more cold, more hostile.*
        - The Forbode, *The world seems calm, suspiciously calm, if cold and hostile.*
        - The Waning Forbode, *The calm of the world shifts to panic, this is your last chance.*

- Winter:
    - Renamed to the Harvest.
    - Massively increased rotspawn spawns, unrelenting.
    - Plants will not grow.
    - Freezing temperature.
    - Flavor text:
        - The Waxing Harvest, *It has arrived.*
        - The Harvest, *The world has fallen unto a state of pain, as if the very ground has become an open sore to the world.*
        - The Waning Harvest, *When will it end?*

Through use of a Wailing Rock (reskin of the Calender), you can view what part of the cycle the Undergarden is in. It will also display the flavor text of thr current part of the cycle when used.

A Wailing Rock will be gifted to the player when they first load into a world. If lost, it can be made by surrounding a Regalium crystal with 4 depthrock pebbles.
