# Idea for a modpack called Subterranea
## Basic Ideas
### Rundown
**Subterranea** is a modpack where you are forever stuck in the Undergarden, a dimension that is quite temperate and damp; full of all sorts of weird and wacky flora, fauna, and materials. This modpack will put as spin on 'survive in *x* dimension' akin to that of popular title modpack **Into the Betweenlands**.

Your one goal (subject to change) is to provide a safe space for yourself to possibly thrive and industrialize in a dimension filled with weird creatures.
### Changes

           <p>Many things will be changed, such as making zombies and skeletons spawn in the Undergarden; renaming them to Rotbrawlers and Rotrangers with, of course, corresponding retextures to expand more on Rotspawn.</p>
           <p>Creepers will also be turned into rotspawn, becoming Rotbombers that leave a wake of rotdust when the explode, creating more Lil' Rotbombers that continue to wreak havoc in the Undergarden.</p>
