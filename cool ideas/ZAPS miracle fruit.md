# Mod idea for a Miracle Berry fruit
### Rundown:
It would be a mod that adds a new fruit, the Miracle Berry!
### Content:
The berry itself would look similar to the Gem Fruit from __Stardew Valley__. When eaten it would give an effect called Transmute that causes all new (as in gained after receiving the Transmute effect) negative potion effects to be converted into their positive version; as in Slowness would turn into Speed, Weakness into Strengh, Poison and Withering into Regeneration. The only drawback is it would cause the converted effect to be on half of its original duration. This drawback can be reverted by getting Transmute II or higher.

One question may be: how would you obtain these? My answer is they would initially be obtained as seeds (called Miracle Seeds) from a Wild Miracle Stem. The wild plant will be hard to find; being quite small, found in flower forests, and blending in with the flowers.

I'm taking inspiration from __Stardew Valley__ for this next tidbit. The crop, when planted, will take forever to grow: 15 days. Other than that, it also can't be bonemealed normally. It has 15 growing stages, but it has to be bonemealed once every stage in order to not die; the crop will wither away when not taken care of. The crop, when fully grown, can be harvested by a right-click and will drop 1-2 berries. The plant will then revert to its 10th stage, and continue growing from there (still have to bonemeal it).

Some additional addends for the crop would be:
- It works with Rich Soil, shortening the growth time by 3 days.
- The crop will give of warning particles if it is close to dying.
- One seed can be made from putting a berry in a crafting interface.

When it comes to food, the berries themselves are average, clocking in at around 3 nutrition, and 3 saturation; they provide only 15 seconds of Transmute I. It can made into a cake (called Miracle Cake), with each bite providing the same stats as a regular cake, with the additon of providing 10 seconds of Transmute 10. If __Farmer's Delight__ is installed cake slice variants of the cake would exist. And if __Neapolitan__ is installed, ice creams and milkshakes (called Miracle Ice Cream and Miracle Milkshake) for the berries would exist. The ice cream would provide 30 seconds of Transmute II, and the milkshake will cause all potion effects to turn into their positive variants with no duration penalty.
