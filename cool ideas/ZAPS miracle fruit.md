# Mod idea for a Miracle Berry fruit
### Rundown:
It would be a mod that adds a new fruit, the Miracle Berry!
### Content:
The berry itself would look similar to the Gem Fruit from __Stardew Valley__. When eaten it would give an effect called Transmute that causes new negative potion effects to be converted into their positive version; as in Slowness would turn into Speed, Weakness into Strengh, Poison and Withering into Regeneration.

The only drawback is it would cause the converted effect to be on lower duration. This drawback can be reverted by getting Transmute II or higher.

One question may be: how would you obtain these? My answer is they would initially be obtained as seeds from a Wild Miracle Stem. The wild plant will be hard to find; being quite small, found in flower forests, and blending in with the flowers.

I'm taking inspiration from __Stardew Valley__ for this next tidbit. The crop, when planted, will take forever to grow: 15 days. Other than that, it also can't be bonemealed normally. It has 15 growing stages, but it has to be bonemealed once every MC day in order to not die; the crop will wither away when not taken care of. The crop, when fully grown, can be harvested by a right-click and will drop 1-2 berries.
