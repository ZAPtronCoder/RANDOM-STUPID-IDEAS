# Mod idea for a Miracle Berry fruit
### Rundown:
It would be a mod that adds a new fruit, the Miracle Berry!
### Content:
The berry itself would look similar to the Gem Fruit from __Stardew Valley__. When eaten it would give an effect called Transmute that causes new negative potion effects to be converted into their positive version; as in Slowness would turn into Speed, Weakness into Strengh, Poison and Withering into Regeneration.

The only drawback is it would cause the converted effect to be on lower duration. This drawback can be reverted by getting Transmute II or higher.
