# Rework idea for __Break My Bones__
### Rundown:
Completely overhaul the combat system (sort of) in a way that would make vanilla combat more immersive, while retaining the original weapons (with adjustments to them, of course). And especially removing __Better Combat__ and __Json Things__ from the list of required mods.
### Weapon reworks (of old weapons):
Below are all the ideas I have for changing the existing weapons in __Break My Bones__.
- **Daggers** can now be thrown. Throwing damage is based on the damage of the dagger and how long it was charged before you attacked. Can be enchanted with Loyalty. Will retain old stats.
- **Rapiers** can now block. Blocking will only protect against 50% of damage. Will retain old stats.
- **Claymores** can now pierce armor... sort of. It will ignore 20% of armor when attacking normally, but if critting or kb-atking it will ignore 40% of armor; stacks with Armor Crunch. Will retain old stats.
- **Hammers** can now temporarily disable blocking (from blocking things like shields and rapiers). Hammers when critting or kb-atking will inflict Armor Crunch. Will retain old stats.
- **Spears** can now be thrown. They will stick to enemies, giving them Bleeding. When the enemy dies or after a certain amount of time the spear will be dropped (longer or shorter based on material used). Multiple spears will increase bleeding level. Can be enchanted with Loyalty; and then in the case of it falling from a enemy, it will return to the player. Will retain old stats.
- **Double Blades** will now be able to attack with both ends. You can now attack with the double blade by right-clicking, it will have its own separate attack cooldown. Will retain old stats.
- **Battle Axes** can now be charged up to do a heavy attack (right-click). Depending on the charge level it will either not inflict Armor Crunch, inflict Armor Crunch, or inflict Armor Crunch II. Crits or kb-atks will inflict Bleeding. Will retain old stats.
- **Glaives** will now be able to give the Hit Streak effect on hit. Has a 10% chance to inflict Bleeding, 20% on crit or kb-atk. Will retain old stats.
- **Sabres** (will probably be renamed to just saber) can now do a slash & dash attack (right-click). It will launch the player and deal damage when passing through mobs. The slash will inflict Bleeding. Has a cooldown. Will retain old stats.
- **Bo-Staffs** can now block. Blocking will only protect against 50% of damage. Blocking will provide Hit Streak for a few seconds. Parries will provide an increased level of Hit Streak (II). Will retain old stats.
- **Zweih√§nders** can now block. Blocking will only protect against 75% of damage. Blocking will "catch" the enemy's melee, dealing 10 durability damage to and temporarily disabling the enemy's melee. Parries will disable the melee for longer and deal additional durability damage. Will retain old stats.
- **Knuckles** will provide Rage on kill. Right-clicking will use all Rage and do an AOE attack with damage scaling based on the amount of Rage consumed. Will retain old stats.
### New weapons (and defensive items):
Of course I have new ideas for cool and gimmicky weapons.
- **Shield** variants for materials other than iron.
- **Parry Shields**, shields that cannot block attacks but can parry with a larger parry window. Attempting to block will hold up the shield for however long the parry window is.
- **Bulwarks**, shields that cannot parry but can be continuously held up and is immune to block disabling. Attempting to parry will function like a normal block. Deals additonal knockback if used to attack.
- **Gauntlets** are a heavier version of the knuckles. Gauntlets deal heavy knockback and have moderate damage and attack speed. Gauntlets build up Rage on kill; and for every level of Rage built up, additional damage is gained (10% more, +10% per level). Right-clicking consumes all rage and causes the user to lunge forward, damaging anything in its path, and inflicting Armor Crunch with its level depending on the level of Rage consumed (level of Rage/2).
- **Polearms** are longer versions of spears. Polearms can be thrown and will stick to targets, causing Armor Crunch and Bleeding II. It takes way longer for the polearm to charge the throw. Follows the same logic with the spear (when it comes to the polearm falling out).
### Mechanic elaboration:
I just want people to understand terms.
- **Disabling** will happen when a weapon or an attack causes a weapon or shield to be temporarily disabled. Disabled weapons and shields cannot be used until the 'cooldown' is over. Works on both players and basic, player-like mobs (zombie variants, skeleton variants).
- **Parrying** will happen when an enemy attacks a block within a certain window. Parrying will reflect the damage or projectile back onto the enemy and provide Retaliation. Golden shields of any kind have an increased parry window.
### Effect elaboration: 
With all these new effects I'm listing I should at least tell you what they do.
- **Armor Crunch** will make all attacks on the victim ignore 20% (+20% per level) of armor. Gains more levels if additional Armor Crunch procs. Caps at V.
- **Bleeding** will deal damage over time (+shortened damage interval per level) that ignores armor and will NOT leave the victim on a half-heart. Prevents natural regen. Gains more levels if additional Bleeding procs. Caps at X.
- **Hit Streak** will increase attack speed by 10% (+10% per level). Gain more levels if additional Hit Streak procs. Caps at X.
- **Rage** does nothing unless a weapon uses Rage. Caps at XX.
- **Retaliation** deal 20% (+20% per level) more damage. Gain more levels if additional Retaliation procs. Remove effect (and levels of effect) when attacking. Caps at X.
