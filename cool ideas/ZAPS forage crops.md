# Forage Crops
## Rundown
My whole idea for this is that these crops would have to be foraged, and could not be farmed.

Most of the crops would be mushrooms, with some outliers. 

Would have Farmer's Delight compatibility, with some additional foods.
## The Roster
### White Truffle
- Found embedded in the dirt underneath the base of Oak and Spruce trees.
   - Gives 1-2 White Truffles when broken.

- Used to make Truffle Oil.
   - Made with 1 Glass Bottle and 3 truffles of any type.

- Can be eaten to give a lot of saturation but little nutrition.
   - Gives 10 seconds of Resistance II when eaten.

- Used in the making a plethora of filling foods.

### Black Truffle
- A little less rare than White Truffles, found embedded in the dirt underneath the base of Dark Oak trees.
   - Gives 1-2 Black Truffles when broken.

- Used to make Truffle Oil.

- Has similar food stats to the White Truffle.

- Used in the making of a plethora of filling foods.

- Can be fed to pigs to make them have larger litters.
